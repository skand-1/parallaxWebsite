            When man-eating Titans first appeared 100 years ago,
            humans found safety behind massive walls that stopped
            the giants in their tracks. But the safety they have had
            for so long is threatened when a colossal Titan smashes
            through the barriers, causing a flood of the giants into
            what had been the humans' safe zone. During the carnage
            that follows, soldier Eren Jaeger sees one of the creatures
            devour his mother, which leads him to vow that he will kill
            every Titan. He enlists some friends who survived to help him,
            and that group is humanity's last hope for avoiding extinction
            at the hands of the monsters.

            In 1945, teenager Seita and his younger sister Setsuko's house is destroyed in a firebombing along with most
            of Kobe. They escape unharmed, but their mother dies from severe burns. Seita conceals their mother's death
            from Setsuko in an attempt to keep her happy, which she later learns of despite Seita's efforts. Seita and
            Setsuko move in with a distant aunt, and Seita retrieves supplies he buried before the bombing and gives
            everything to his aunt, save for a tin of Sakuma drops. The aunt convinces Seita to sell his mother's silk
            kimono for rice as rations shrink and the number of refugees in the house grows. Seita uses some of his
            mother's money in the bank to buy supplies, but eventually, the aunt becomes resentful of the children,
            deeming them unworthy of earning her food.
